The following project is a market segmentaion on fast food case study. There are ten major steps involving market segmentation which are as discussed below : 
Step 1: Deciding (Not) to Segment
-- Determine whether segmentation is appropriate for your organization.
-- Assess if benefits outweigh costs and if the organization has the capability to implement segmentation.
-- Be aware of internal resistance and implementation barriers.

Step 2: Specifying the Ideal Target Segment
-- Define what the ideal segment would look like using knock-out and attractiveness criteria.
-- Use structured processes to evaluate potential segment features such as size, accessibility, and profitability.

Step 3: Collecting Data
-- Gather relevant data needed for segmentation.
-- Choose appropriate segmentation variables (e.g., demographics, psychographics, behavior).
-- Decide whether to use data from surveys, internal systems, or experiments.
-- Ensure data quality and sample size are adequate.

Step 4: Exploring Data
-- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to detect patterns, errors, or outliers.
-- Perform data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and pre-processing (e.g., normalization or encoding).
-- Use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

Step 5: Extracting Segments
-- Apply clustering algorithms or model-based techniques to group similar consumers.
-- Methods include k-means, hierarchical clustering, mixture models, and self-organizing maps.
-- Use statistical indices (e.g., silhouette score) to assess quality and stability of the segment solution.

Step 6: Profiling Segments
-- Identify key characteristics of each segment using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
-- Focus on features that differentiate one segment from another.
-- Present findings clearly to stakeholders using effective graphical tools.

Step 7: Describing Segments
-- Use external descriptor variables (like income, education, or media usage) to enhance the understanding of each segment.
-- Apply visualization, statistical testing, and predictive modeling (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to validate and interpret differences.

Step 8: Selecting (the) Target Segment(s)
-- Evaluate and choose the segment(s) that best align with strategic goals.
-- Consider segment attractiveness, organizational fit, and feasibility.
-- Use a structured approach to avoid bias or arbitrary decisions.

Step 9: Customising the Marketing Mix
-- Design tailored marketing mix strategies (Product, Price, Place, Promotion) for the selected segments.
-- Ensure internal consistency across the 4Ps.
-- Consider multiple-segment strategies carefully to avoid cannibalization.

Step 10: Evaluation and Monitoring
-- Continuously monitor the performance of the segmentation strategy.
-- Assess if segments are still relevant and effective.
-- Watch for segment hopping, instability, or evolving market dynamics.
-- Update segmentation strategies based on market feedback and changes.
